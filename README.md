# OIBGRIP---Data-Science-Internship
This internship was all about data science and analytics. I applied for this internship from the website of Oasis Infobyte. 
The description of all the tasks completed is given below:

Task-1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
I predicted the species of IRIS Flower using the attributes given such as:  petal width, sepal width, petal length and sepal length,. 

Task-2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS
I explored the dataset by creating various charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python for unemployment analysis.

TASK-3 CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the good will of the brand of the car, features of the car, horoscope and the milage it gives and many more. Car
price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
